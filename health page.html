            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>E-waste, including discarded phones, computers, and other electronics, poses significant health risks due to toxic chemicals such as lead, mercury, and cadmium. When improperly disposed of, these toxins can leach into soil and water, affecting food sources and drinking water. Exposure to these substances has been linked to severe health problems, including neurological disorders, respiratory issues, and reproductive harm.</p>

        <section class="south-africa">
            <h2>Health Risks in South Africa</h2>
            <p>In South Africa, informal e-waste recycling is common in some areas, putting workers at risk of direct exposure to harmful chemicals. Communities living near e-waste dumps are particularly vulnerable to the resulting air and water pollution.</p>
